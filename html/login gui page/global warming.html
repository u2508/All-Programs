<P>Global warming is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system; an aspect of climate change shown by 
    temperature measurements and by multiple effects of the warming.Though earlier geological periods also experienced episodes
     of warming, the term commonly refers to the observed and continuing increase in average air and ocean temperatures since 1900
    caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the modern industrial economy.In the modern context the terms global 
    warming and climate change are commonly used interchangeably, but climate change includes both global warming and its effects, 
    such as changes to precipitation and impacts that differ by region.</P>

<p>Many of the observed changes in climate since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record, and in historical
    and paleoclimate proxy records of climate change over thousands to millions of years. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
    Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, "It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant 
    cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse    
    gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that
     during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 째C (0.5 to 3.1 째F) in a moderate 
     scenario, or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 째C (4.7 to 8.6 째F) in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas 
     emissions and on climate feedback effects.</p>

<P>These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized
        nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.
       Effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more
        frequent extreme weather events such as heat1 waves, and expansion of deserts. Surface 
        temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers,
         permafrost, and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but 
         for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead. Climate change impacts humans 
         by, amongst other things, threatening food security from decreasing crop yields, and the 
         abandonment of populated areas and damage to infrastructure due to rising sea levels. 
         Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of ecosystems as they adapt to
          climate change, with coral reefs, mountain ecosystems, and Arctic ecosystems most 
          immediately threatened. Because the climate system has a large "inertia" and greenhouse 
          gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, climatic changes and their effects 
          will continue to become more pronounced for many centuries even if further increases to 
          greenhouse gases stop.</P>
