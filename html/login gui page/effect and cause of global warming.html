<strong><B><H1>effects of global warming</H1></B></strong>
<p>Many impacts of climate change have already been observed, including glacier retreat, changes in the timing of
 seasonal events (e.g., earlier flowering of plants), and changes in agricultural productivity.Anthropogenic 
 forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes, including sea level rise, changes in climate 
 extremes, declines in Arctic sea ice extent and glacier retreat.Future effects of climate change will vary 
 depending on climate change policies and social development.The two main policies to address climate change are 
 reducing human greenhouse gas emissions (climate change mitigation) and adapting to the impacts of climate change.
Geoengineering is another policy option. Near-term climate change policies could significantly affect long-term climate
 change impacts.
